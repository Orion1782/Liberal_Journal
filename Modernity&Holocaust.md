## Introduction
three conditions that erode moral inhibitions:

1) Authority (authorization of violence);
2) Routinization (make the work routine, getting used to vialance);
3) Dehumanization (or demoralization, excluding someone out of moral universe).


three processes to make the crime morally invisible:
 
1) Mediating the action of killing
2) Making the victims invisible - killing at greater and greater distances
3) Making the humanity of the person disappear.
